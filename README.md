# JQueryCalc

This Repo is a template!

### Steps
1. Make sure you make a copy of the template and then clone the copy
2. Invite your team members to this repo
3. Have everyone clone down the repo

Our Process:

1. Link html to javascript.

2. Declare variables.

2. Created a function to capture the number when it is clicked & append to page. Created two seperate number variables for later use with operators.  

3. Created an on-click function for operator that changes the indicator so that the next number will display on the second line and get and display the operator. 

4. Create on-click function for the = sign for the calculator to function inside. 

5. Inside function we get the operator text and convert the numbers entered into an integer using parseInt(). 

6. Set up if statements for the different functions of the calculator, close the if statements and have the calculator display the result. 

7. Set up clear function so that all operators are clear and only the result shows on screen.
